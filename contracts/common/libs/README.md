# Common Library contracts

This directory contains common library contracts in use in the contract suite, with the exception of third-party libraries (such as OpenZeppelin's Arrays Upgradeable, used in Child Validator Set).

There is natspec on the contracts, along with markdown docs automatically generated from the natspec in the [`docs/`](./../../../docs) directory at the project root.

## `SafeMathInt.sol`

Conversion between `uint256` and `int256`.
